Exercise 12: FizzBuzz with arrays

1) Choose a method to iterate through the `nums` array.

   - Push any number evenly divisible by 5 to an array called `buzz`.
   - Push any number that is evenly divisible by 3 and 5 to an array called
     `fizzbuzz`.

   Note: A single number may meet more than one of the above rules. If it does,
         it should be placed in multiple arrays. For example, the number `15`
         will appear in the `fizz`, `buzz`, and `fizzbuzz` arrays.

Complete Exercise 12 in the space below:*/

/* store the results in three separate arrays, namely fizzbuzz, fizz, and buzz, instead of printing them. It iterates over an array called nums using a for loop.

The for loop starts with the initialization of a variable i, which is set to 0. The condition i < nums.length ensures that the loop continues to run as long as the value of i is less than the length of the nums array. The final expression i++ increments i by 1 after each loop iteration.

Inside the loop, a series of if and else-if statements check each number in the nums array for divisibility by 3 and 5.

The first if statement checks if the current number nums[i] is divisible by both 3 and 5. This is done using the modulus operator %, which returns the remainder of a division. If nums[i] is divisible by both 3 and 5, the remainder will be 0 for both operations, and the number is added to the fizzbuzz array using the push method.

If the number is not divisible by both 3 and 5, the code moves to the else-if statements. The first else-if checks if the number is divisible by 3. If it is, the number is added to the fizz array. The second else-if checks if the number is divisible by 5. If it is, the number is added to the buzz array.

If a number is not divisible by 3 or 5, it is ignored, and the loop moves to the next number in the nums array.*/
